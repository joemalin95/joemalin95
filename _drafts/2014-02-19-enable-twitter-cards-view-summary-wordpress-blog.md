If your blog is running on WordPress then in just 3 easy steps you can enable <strong>Twitter Cards,</strong> which will allow tweets containing links from your blog to display rich media (title, post summary and featured image) like shown below.

When you enable Twitter Cards, any links shared by others from your blog, will automatically include your Twitter handle. For e.g. in the above tweet shared by @<b>Win8DevNews, </b>we can see twitter handle of @<b>SuperDevRes42</b> included as source.

Not only that, if your blog is multi-authored. The author's twitter handle also gets included. Like mine (@<b>kanishkkunal</b>) is included in the tweet shown above.
<h2>Steps to enable Twitter Cards</h2>
<h3>1. Install WordPress SEO by Yoast</h3>
There are many other plugins which can do this job, however I recommend using <a href="http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/" target="_blank">WordPress SEO by Yoast</a> as it makes itself useful in more than one way.
<h3>2. Enable Twitter card Meta data</h3>
Once the plugin is installed, enable Twitter card meta data in <strong>SEO → Social</strong>. Also specify the Twitter Username which you want to be included as source (personal twitter handle for personal blogs, publisher's twitter handle for multi-authored blogs). Save Changes once you are done.

Additionally, for multi-authored blogs, authors should set their twitter handle in their user profile.
<h3>3. Validate your content with Twitter</h3>
This is an <strong>important</strong> step and unless you do so, the summary won't appear. As a website owner you must opt-in to have cards displayed for your domain, and Twitter must approve the integration.

Go to <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/validation/validator" target="_blank">Twitter Card Validator</a> and login with your twitter account.

Switch to the "<strong>Validate &amp; Apply</strong>" tab and enter URL of one of the posts from your blog and hit GO.

Twitter will do it's verification of tags and display the tags it found. Furthermore it will display that your domain is not yet approved and give you an option to "Request Approval". Hit on the "<strong>Request Approval</strong>" button, then fill and submit the form that appears next.

<a href="http://kanishkkunal.in/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/Twitter-Card-Validator.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-449" alt="Twitter-Card-Validator" src="http://kanishkkunal.in/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/Twitter-Card-Validator.png" width="387" height="390" /></a>

After you submit the form, Twitter displays a message that says that they will review your request and to expect a few weeks turn-around time. However, in my case, the approval was <strong>instant</strong>.

Once you receive a mail from Twitter confirming the activation of Twitter Cards, tweets containing links from your blog will include the rich media with them. :)

Hope this helps in improving your social media engagement! Let me know in comments in case you face any difficulty in setting this up.
