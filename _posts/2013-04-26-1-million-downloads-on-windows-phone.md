Achievement unlocked: 1 year 6 months, four (x2) apps and a million downloads on windows phone.

Sometimes I wonder if I could have made anything close to this on any other platform. What I feel is that being associated with a fast growing platform like windows phone made the growth of my apps much easier than what it would have been on any other platform.  Also I believe that I was lucky that most of the things went in right way making even simplest of my apps popular and well rated. I am thankful to all my supporters and well-wishers.

&nbsp;

Let me take this opportunity to share some of the steps I took and advices I followed while making apps for windows phone:
<ol>
	<li>Focus on a few core features and do it well.</li>
	<li>Don’t offer over complicated features and customization settings that no one would understand how to use without help documents.</li>
	<li>Make simple straightforward user interface that adapts well with Windows Phone UI.</li>
	<li>No app idea is small idea when you are making apps for mobile devices.</li>
	<li>Marketing your apps on social networks is a good idea, but overdoing it is not.</li>
	<li>Networking with other windows phone developer on Twitter is the best way for getting useful resource, tips and insights. (Check for people tweeting with <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23wpdev&amp;src=typd" target="_blank">#wpdev</a>)</li>
	<li>If your app is ad-supported don’t forget to integrate with <a href="http://www.adduplex.com?ref=wr9883" target="_blank">AdDuplex</a> for free cross-promotion of your apps.</li>
	<li>It’s a good idea to buy some paid advertising from AdDuplex as well to give yourself a kick in new+rising category.</li>
	<li>Getting your apps reviewed by Windows Phone sites like <a href="http://www.wpcentral.com/add-twist-your-messages-mytexttwister" target="_blank">WPCentral</a>, <a href="http://wmpoweruser.com/mytexttwister-add-unlimited-fun-to-sms-email-facebook-and-twitter/" target="_blank">WMPoweruser</a>, <a href="http://windowsphoneparent.com/best-windows-phone-app-review-for-texting-mytexttwister/" target="_blank">WPParent</a> etc. would boost your downloads.</li>
	<li>Don’t forget to submit the “Panorama background art” image or else your app won’t get featured as the main (1st) app by the store.</li>
</ol>
