<strong>[Update] </strong><em>Interestingly, some of the publishers and apps mentioned below have now gone missing from Windows Phone store after I wrote about them here. </em>

While browsing through the Windows Phone app store in search of new apps, I came across several interesting names kept by app publishers that I thought worth sharing with everyone. Let me start with a disclaimer first.
<h4>Disclaimer</h4>
<blockquote>I am just listing few publisher names that I found interesting and worth sharing and by no means I am trying to say that they are bad or good or anything else.</blockquote>
<h3></h3>
Ok, now that we are done with the disclaimer let me start with names that follow a similar trait.

The first one is <strong>Microsoft WP Developer. </strong>Yes Really! Check out below link and screen clip to believe it. They have fairly good number of apps with good number of ratings. <a title="View apps by Microsoft WP Developer " href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/store/publishers?publisherId=Microsoft%2BWP%2BDeveloper" target="_blank">View apps by Microsoft WP Developer<strong> </strong></a>

<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/store/publishers?publisherId=Microsoft%2BWP%2BDeveloper" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-208" alt="MicrosoftWPDeveloper" src="http://kanishkkunal.kunruchcreations.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/05/MicrosoftWPDeveloper.png" width="619" height="377" /></a>

&nbsp;

And here is another one with similar name -<strong> Microsoft Windows Phone Developer. </strong>They have a wide variety of apps including Tips and Tricks for lot of your favorite services like Facebook, Twitter even outlook and Skype. Check out there apps at <a title="Apps from Microsoft Windows Phone Developer" href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/store/publishers?publisherId=Microsoft%2BWindows%2BPhone%2BDeveloper&amp;appId=71e224a5-544f-4940-a445-38c8e6461f0f" target="_blank">this link</a>.

<a title="Apps from Microsoft Windows Phone Developer" href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/store/publishers?publisherId=Microsoft%2BWindows%2BPhone%2BDeveloper&amp;appId=71e224a5-544f-4940-a445-38c8e6461f0f" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-209" alt="MicrosoftWindowsPhoneDeveloper" src="http://kanishkkunal.kunruchcreations.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/05/MicrosoftWindowsPhoneDeveloper.png" width="852" height="311" /></a>

&nbsp;

I managed to stumble across another one named <strong>Microsoft Application Developer </strong>and they have tips and tricks for WhatsApp and WP7 among <a title="Apps from Microsoft Application Developer" href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/store/publishers?publisherId=Microsoft%2BApplication%2BDeveloper&amp;appId=57235306-db14-4a9f-97ad-9d87b4d1912c" target="_blank">many other apps</a>.

<a title="Apps from Microsoft Application Developer" href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/store/publishers?publisherId=Microsoft%2BApplication%2BDeveloper&amp;appId=57235306-db14-4a9f-97ad-9d87b4d1912c" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211" alt="MicrosoftApplicationDeveloper" src="http://kanishkkunal.kunruchcreations.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/05/MicrosoftApplicationDeveloper.png" width="799" height="296" /></a>

&nbsp;

Well, by now you would have guessed what's common in all of the above? They all claim to be <em>Microsoft developer</em> or <em>Windows Phone developer</em>. While I don't disapprove the fact that they are <em>Windows Phone developers</em> but having such a name would potentially attract legal actions from Microsoft and would also confuse the users.

&nbsp;

But wait, didn't you come here to find interesting publisher names? If you were not able to find any till now, then I am almost certain that the followings would amuse you.

<strong>"In Lack Of A Better Name" - </strong>No words necessary to describe why I found this one interesting. If you don't believe me and the screenclip below then <a title="Apps from In Lack Of A Better Name" href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/store/publishers?publisherId=In%2BLack%2BOf%2BA%2BBetter%2BName&amp;appId=6fca5cff-0dc4-4aad-bc77-0882f8810b65" target="_blank">check it out at the store</a>.<a title="Apps from In Lack Of A Better Name" href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/store/publishers?publisherId=In%2BLack%2BOf%2BA%2BBetter%2BName&amp;appId=6fca5cff-0dc4-4aad-bc77-0882f8810b65" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-212" alt="InLackOfABetterName" src="http://kanishkkunal.kunruchcreations.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/05/InLackOfABetterName.png" width="824" height="321" /></a>

&nbsp;

Is that all? How about this legendary publisher who wins my vote for being the most amusing. Not only is this publisher trying to prove that <strong>Apps from WP is better than iOS and Android, </strong>they are also <a title="Apps from WP is better than iOS and Android" href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/publishers?publisherId=WP%2Bis%2Bbetter%2Bthan%2BiOS%2Band%2BAndroid" target="_blank">pro-actively contributing</a> (more than anyone else) to the ever increasing app count on Windows Phone in order to surpass the number of apps on iOS and Android as soon as possible.

<a title="Apps from WP is better than iOS and Android" href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/publishers?publisherId=WP%2Bis%2Bbetter%2Bthan%2BiOS%2Band%2BAndroid" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-216" alt="Apps-from-WP-is-better-than-iOS-and-Android" src="http://kanishkkunal.kunruchcreations.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/05/Apps-from-WP-is-better-than-iOS-and-Android.png" width="749" height="444" /></a>

&nbsp;

<strong>Bonus:</strong>

Apps from <a title="Apps from Professional Developers" href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/store/publishers?publisherId=Professional%2BDevelopers&amp;appId=f15f407e-5c42-4110-9858-03c29abce0de" target="_blank">Professional Developers </a>- with rather misleading app named <a title="Download Temple Run" href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/download-temple-run/f15f407e-5c42-4110-9858-03c29abce0de" target="_blank">Download Temple Run</a>

Another misleading app named <a title="Subway Surfer Scorer" href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/subway-surfer-scorer/11ac75c6-e35b-4b05-9855-da36695e58c2" target="_blank">Subway Surfer Scorer </a>by XAppers Studios with proof (see no. of reviews) that at least 66 people fell into their trap.<a title="Subway Surfer Scorer in Windows Phone Store" href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/subway-surfer-scorer/11ac75c6-e35b-4b05-9855-da36695e58c2" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-223" alt="SubwaySurferWindowsPhone" src="http://kanishkkunal.kunruchcreations.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/05/SubwaySurferWindowsPhone.png" width="527" height="472" /></a>

That's all I have. If you ever came across such interesting <em>publisher names or app names</em> on the Windows Phone store then do let everyone know in the comments.
