What does a developer ask from Santa on Christmas? A new gadget and all would be cool but how about a million downloads of the apps he made? Well, this year it was double the Christmas presents for me when downloads of my apps on Windows Phone reached 2 million.

<a href="http://kanishkkunal.in/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/12/2-million-downloads1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-315" alt="2-million-downloads" src="http://kanishkkunal.in/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/12/2-million-downloads1.jpg" width="288" height="375" /></a>

Only 8 months back, I had posted about <a title="1 million downloads on Windows Phone.." href="http://kanishkkunal.in/1-million-downloads-on-windows-phone/" target="_blank">a million downloads</a> of my apps. Around that time I took an <a title="Leaving Microsoft and starting a new Journey" href="http://kanishkkunal.in/leaving-microsoft-and-starting-a-new-journey/" target="_blank">important decision of my career</a> and decided to become a full time Apps Developer leaving my job at Microsoft. Today I am very happy to have followed my passion. To be master of my own time is a joy of its own.

In this blog post I will share some stats about my apps on Windows Phone. Also, just like in <a title="1 million downloads on Windows Phone.." href="http://kanishkkunal.in/1-million-downloads-on-windows-phone/" target="_blank">the last post</a> where I shared few tips and advices on my success, I have something to give to the developer community on this occasion. Read on till the last to find what it is.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">A gift for other developers like me</h2>
I wanted to share all the resources and links that I collected over the past few years related to Windows Phone and Windows 8 development. However the list grew so big that a single blog post wouldn't have done justice to it. So I decided to categorize and bring them together into a companion web-site for Windows Phone and Windows 8 developers. Now, I have just one link to share with you today: <a title="Super dev resources" href="http://superdevresources.com/" target="_blank">superdevresources.com</a>

I hope that you will find this useful in your journey as a developer. Please <a title="Design, development, marketing and monetization resources for developers" href="http://kanishkkunal.in/superdevresources/">read about it in detail here</a>.
