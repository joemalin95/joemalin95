As you may already know, I started developing <strong>WordPress themes</strong> about a month back and released my first theme called <a title="Fastr – a simple, elegant &amp; fast WordPress theme" href="http://kanishkkunal.in/fastr-simple-elegant-fast-wordpress-theme/"><strong>Fastr</strong></a> for free download. However, calling myself a theme developer, while having my own sites using themes developed by others, seemed a bit awkward to me. Therefore, I dedicated last few weeks to update all my sites with self-made themes.

The result of about three weeks of work was two new WordPress themes, <strong>Developr</strong> and <strong>SuperDev. </strong>(Couldn't think of better names.)

<strong>Developr</strong> is being used in the following sites managed by me:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://kunruchcreations.com/">http://kunruchcreations.com/</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://apps.kunruchcreations.com/">http://apps.kunruchcreations.com/</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://kanishkkunal.in/">http://kanishkkunal.in/</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://themes.kanishkkunal.in/">http://themes.kanishkkunal.in/</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://monika.kunruchcreations.com/">http://monika.kunruchcreations.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<strong>SuperDev</strong> is powering the following sites that I manage:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://superdevresources.com/">http://superdevresources.com/</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://blog.superdevresources.com/">http://blog.superdevresources.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<strong>Source code</strong> of these themes is accessible from <a href="https://github.com/kanishkkunal" target="_blank">my git hub page</a> and  you are free to use it to develop your own themes.

I have used <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> to build these themes and focused on following aspects while developing it:
<ul>
	<li>Simplicity &amp; Readablity</li>
	<li>Speed</li>
	<li>Responsiveness</li>
	<li>Brand should stand out (even personal branding)</li>
</ul>
Nothing can be perfect right from the start and that is why your <strong>feedback</strong> is welcome!
