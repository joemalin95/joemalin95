description: A statement describing my money back guarantee.
---

So I'm supposed to pay for a song that I've never even heard?!

I understand that music can be very subjective. I also understand any reservations you may have about paying for a personal song that you have yet to hear. Definitely check out my [sample songs](/sample) to get a feel for my musical style. However, in the sad and unfortunate event that you hate your song, I also offer a money back guarantee. If you receive your song and in any way feel that you were ripped off, shoot me an email explaining why you were not satisfied and I will refund your money in full. 

It is my goal to make this mutally rewarding for both myself and you. It is my aim for you to feel that you recieved a song worth more than the price you've paid. It is my promise that my heart and soul will be poured into every song I write.
