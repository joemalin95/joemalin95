description: A statement describing my money back guarantee.
---

I understand that music can be very subjective. I also understand any reservations you may have about paying for a personal song that you have yet to hear. While I highly recommend that you check out my [sample songs](/sample) to get a feel for my musical style, I also offer a money back guarantee. If you receive your song and for any reason feel that you were gypped, shoot me an email explaining why you were not satisfied and I will refund your money in full. 

It is my goal to make this mutally rewarding for both myself and you. It is my aim for you to feel that you recieved a song worth more than the price you've paid. It is my promise that my heart and soul will be poured into every song I write.
