<h2>What is the Song Cafe?</h2>
</div>

The Song Cafe allows you to order an original acoustic song written just for you. Whether you're trying to knock someone's socks off with a creative and thoughtful gift, in need of a theme song for your new youtube channel, or just want a song that captures what's going on in your life right now, I am here to help you out. My name is Joey Malinowski and I've been a singer/songwritter for 7 years now. It is my goal to make any song idea you have come to life.
